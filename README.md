The aimbot is only really for automatics. The aimbot triggers once you have shot more than 0 bullets (m_iShotsFired).

The RCS is experimental but i think it does compensate recoil well. 

If you encounter errors or bugs feel free to open an issue. 

Ill also take certain feature requests. Just open an issue.
